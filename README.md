## Building a test Jenkins locally with our bootstrap seed job

The following will build up a jenkins container at localhost:8080

```
$ ./run_test_jenkins.sh -b
```

- After building up the localhost jenkins clone, you will need to login; the autogenerated login is admin/admin.
- Run the bootstrap job at the top level of the jenkins container; this will seed a folder called Seed-Folder, based off the bootstrap script found at `job-dsl/bootstrap.groovy`


If you modify the `bootstrap.groovy` script and want to rebuild, you may do this as follows:
```
$ ./run_test_jenkins.sh -r
```
